# nnet

A flexible neural network library for Clojure


## Installation

    $ mvn install


## Usage

    (ns your.project
      (:use [sbhaaf/nnet.core :as nn]))


## Examples

Basic MLP:

    (nn/nnet {:dense [10 100 1]
              :hidden_act 'sigmoid  
	      :output_act 'sigmoid})
	      
or simply:

    (nn/nnet [10 100 1]) 
    

Sequential model:

    (nn/nnet {:sequential [model1 model2]} params)


Parallel model:

    (nn/nnet {:parallel [model1 model2]
              :inputs :shared})
    (nn/nnet {:parallel [model1 model2]
              :inputs :unique}) ;; default if not specified


Usage:

    (nn/predict model inps)


Training:

    (def params {:epochs 10 :batch_size 64 :lr 0.01 :loss 'mse}
    (def model (nn/fit model inps outs [params]))
    

Where loss functions can be defined:

    (def myLoss {:fn (fn [obs tru] (* (- (tru obs)) (- (tru obs))))
                 :dfn (fn [obs tru] (* -2 (- (tru obs))))})


And activation layers:

    (def myAct {:fn #(/ 1 (+ 1 (exp (* -1 %))))
                :dfn #(* (/ 1 (+ 1 (exp (* -1 %)))) (- 1 (/ 1 (+ 1 (exp (* -1 %))))))})


### TODO

* Parallel module needs work
* Need to define more loss functions and activation functions
* Rewrite structure to add layers without editing core functions
* Make single input callable from different locations
  * similar to Keras functional API
  * maybe reference by names
* Function to print model structure
* GPU!
* Efficiency
